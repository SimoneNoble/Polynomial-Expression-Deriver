# Polynomial-Expression-Deriver

A C++ program that both (a) creates a sequence of numbers from an algebraic expression, and (b) derives algebraic expressions used to create a sequence of numbers. Input/output sets are able to be saved and read from files.

(Algebraic expressions are limited to the existence of a single variable, a highest degree of 4, a highest coefficient of 9, highest constant of 100, and restricted to the operators of + or - only between terms).
